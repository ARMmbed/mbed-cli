# Arm Mbed command-line interface

*Mbed CLI* is the name of the Arm Mbed command-line tool, packaged as `mbed-cli`, which enables the full Mbed workflow: repositories version control, maintaining dependencies, publishing code, updating from remotely hosted repositories (GitHub, GitLab and mbed.org) and invoking Arm Mbed's own build system and export functions, among other operations.
