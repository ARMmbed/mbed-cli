# mbed Command Line Interface

*mbed CLI* is the name of the ARM mbed command line tool, packaged as mbed-cli, which enables the full mbed workflow: repositories version control, maintaining dependencies, publishing code, updating from remotely hosted repositories (GitHub, GitLab and mbed.org), and invoking ARM mbed's own build system and export functions, among other operations.
